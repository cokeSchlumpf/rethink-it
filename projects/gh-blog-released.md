# Publishing made simple with gh-blog

About one or two years ago I started a small blog on [ghost.org](https://ghost.org). I really loved the simple interface and editing my posts with plain Markdown. After Ghost was now raising its prices and is focusing more on professional and regular bloggers I decided to write my own little blogging platform.

After a few days of thinking (and of course hacking) how to keep blogging as simple as possible without putting a lot of effort in the creation of a new platform I came up with a very simple solution: [gh-blog](https://github.com/cokeSchlumpf/gh-blog) is a simple view layer for a GitHub repository containing the data and templates of a blog. It also leverages GitHub's Markdown rendering.

Thanks to a lot of great open-source developers it just took me a few hours to put together a new running platform. It's now published on IBM Bluemix and can be used by everyone there or by deploying an own instance. Find out more about gh-blog on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cokeSchlumpf/gh-blog).

Feedback and suggestions for further improvements are appreciated.
